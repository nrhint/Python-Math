4.2 Projectile Motion for an Object Launched Horizontally

Example 1:

If an arrow is fired from a bow with a perfectly horizontal velocity of 60.0 m/s and the arrow was 2.00 m above the ground when the it was released, how far will the arrow fly horizontally before it strikes the ground?

This problem is solved by determining how long it takes the arrow to fall to the ground in exactly the same manner as if the arrow was dropped with no horizontal velocity. The time required for the arrow to fall to the ground will be the same time that the arrow flies horizontally at 60.0 m/s, so

d = 1/2*at**2 solved for t = sqrt(2d/a) = sqrt((2)(2.00 m)/9.80m/s^2) = 0.639

The time required for the fall is multiplied by the horizontal velocity to get the horizontal distance.

dHorizontal = (vHorizontal)(time) = (60.0 m/s)(0.639 s) = 38.3 m
