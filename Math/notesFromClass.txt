Topic: Finding the maximum or minimum of a quadratic function

Answer the questions about the quadratic function:

g(x)=-3x^2+6x-7

Does the function have a Max or Min value

Where does the Max or Min value occur:

What is the functions Max or Min value:


The graph on a quadratic function g(x)=ax^2+bx+c is a parabola.
We are given g(x)=-3^2+6x-7. the leading coefficient a=-3 is negative.
So the parabola opens downward and g has a maxium value.
If the parabola opened up than g would have a Min value.

For our function a=-3, b=6 and c=-7 we get the following:

x=-b/2a = -6/2(-3)=1

so the x cord of the vertex is 1
We use this to find the y cord of the vertex

y=g(x) = -3(1)^2+6(1)-7 = -3+6-7 = -4

The vertex is (1, -4)

Write the quadratic function in the form f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k
Then give the vertex of its graph

EXAMPLE:

f(x)=2x^2+12x+17

Writen in sepcified form: f(x)=f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k
Vertex: (h, k)

a quadratic function fan be written in the form f(x)=a(x-h)^2+k where a, h, and k are constants and a != 0

The graph of such a function is a parabola whose vertex is (h, k)

We can rewrite f(x)=2x^2+12x+17 in this form by completing the square
We start with the first twe terms:

f(x)=2x^2+12x+17
f(x)=2(x^2+6x)+17

Finding the x-intercept(s) and the vertex of a parabola


USE PARENS WHEN SUBUSTUITIN INTO QALCULATE!


Find the x-intercept(s) and the coordinates of the vertex for the parabola y=x^2+10x+21. If there is more than one x-intercept, separate them with commas.

Finding the x-intercept(s)
An x-intercept is the x-coordinate of a point where the graph crosses the x-axis. A parabola can have zero, one, or two x-intercepts.

At each point where a graph crosses the x-axis, the y-coordinate is 0.
To find any x-intercepts of the parabola y=x^2+10x+21, we let y=0 and solve the resulting quadratic equation.

y=x^2+10x+21
0=x^2+10x+21
0=(x+7)(x+3)

soluution: x= -7 OR -3

So there are two x-intercepts which are -7 and -3


Finding the vertex
We found that the x-intercepts are -7 and -3, so the parabola intersects the x-axis at (-7,0) and -3,0). The parabola can be up or down still untin we find the vertex point

In either case, the vertex lies on the axis of symmetry. This means that the x-coordinate of the vertex lies midway between -7 and -3. Using the midpoint formula, we get the following.

x-cordinate of vertex = -7+(-3)/2 = -5

Plugging x = -5 into y=x^2+10x+21 we can find the y-cordinate of the vertex.

y=x^2+10x+21
y=(-5)^2+10(-5)+21
y=25-50+21
y=-4

so the vertex has the cordinates of (-5, -4)


if the parabloa only has one x intercept than this x intercept is the vertex and the answer is (x, 0) and x






The length of a rectangle is 1yd more than twice the width, and the area of the rectangle is 28yd^2. Find the dimensions of the rectangle.


let L be the length
let w be the width

l=2w+1
l*w=28

we subustutite the expression for l:

(2w+1)w=28
2w^2+w=28   (mutuply out the paren)
2w^2+w-28=0
(2w-7)(w+4)=0

w = -4 OR 3.5

negative lengths are not allowed so use 3.5

l=2w+1
l=2*3.5+1
l=6+1

Finding the final amount in a word problem on compound interest

EXAMPLE:

Suppose that 2000 is loaned at a rate of 15%, compounded monthly. Assuming that no payments are made, find the amount owed after 5 years.
Do not round any intermediate computations, and round your answer to the nearest cent.

The fina amount A owed is given by the compound intrest formula:

A=P(1+r/n)^nt

P=2000 (starting amount)
r=15% = 0.15 (Interest rate)
n=12 (number of times per year)
t=5 (Total time in years)

Finding the initial amount and rate of change given an exponential function

EXAMPLE:

A study is done on the number of bacteria cells in a petri dish. Suppose that the population size p(t) after t hours is given by the following exponential function.


A function in the following form models exponential growth or decay.

y=ab^t (where a >0, b>0 and b =! 1)

Here y is an amount and t is the time since some starting point. Note the following:

The constant a is the initial amount, that is, the value of y at t=0.

The constant b tells whether the function models exponential growth or decay.
If b>1, then the function models growth.
If b<1, then the function models decay.

From the value of b, we can also get the rate of growth or decay.
If b>1, then b equals 1+r, where r is the rate of growth.
That is, r is the percent increase (expressed as a decimal) for each increase of one unit in t.
If b<1, then b equals 1-r, where r is the rate of decay.
That is, r is the percent decrease (expressed as a decimal) for each increase of one unit in t.



Writing an exponential function rule given a table of ordered pairs

The table of ordered pairs (x, y) gives an exponential function.
Write an equation for the function.


(x, y)
(-1, 1/12)
(0, 1/2)
(1, 3)
(2, 18)

y=a*b**x, where a =! 0 b >0 and b =! 1

a is the intercept of the graph

the intercept is 1/2:

y=1/2*b^x

to find b we subustutite another point in the equation:

y=1/2*b^x
3=1/2*b^1
2*3=2*1/2*b^1  (Mutuplying both sides by 2)
6=b

The function can be written by y=1/2*6^x

y=25*b^x

Finding a final amount in a word problem on exponential growth or decay

EXAMPLE:

An amount of 47000 is borrowed for 6 years at 4.25 interest, compounded annually. If the loan is paid in full at the end of that period, how much must be paid back?
Use the calculator provided and round your answer to the nearest dollar.

The original amount borrowed is 47000.
After the first year, the amount due is the original amount increased by 4.25%.
So, the amount due after the first year is given by the following:
47000+47000*0.0425=47000(1+0.0425)=47000(1.0425)
Similarly, after the second year the amount due increases by another 4.25%.
So, the amount due after the second year is as follows:
(47000*1.0425)(1.0425)=47000*1.0425^2
Here is the amount due after the third year:
(47000*1.0425^2)(1.0425)=47000*1.0425^3
We see that after t years, the amount due will be 1.0425^t times the original amount borrowed.
So, the amount due after t years is given by the following:
47000*1.0425*t
In this problem, we need to find the amount due after 6 years.
47000*1.0425^6=60332.9...
Rounded to the nearest dollar, we get:
60333

Finding domain and range from the graph of an exponential function

(a)To find the domain, we project the graph onto the x-axis.
Because the graph extends to the left and right forever, all real numbers are in the domain.

(b)To find the range, we project the graph onto the y-axis.
The asymptote is the horizontal line y=-2.
The graph gets closer to this line without ever touching it.
The value -2 is not included in the range.
And the graph extends downward forever.

All values less than -2 are part of the range.
Therefore, the range of our function is given by y<-2.

-3y=8x+8
y=(8x+8)/-3
y = 8x/-3+8/-3


-----------------------------------------------

-x-6y=-4
-6y=x-4
y=(x-4)/-6
y = (x/-6)-(4/6)


-----------------------------------------------
2y=5x+7
y=(5x+7)/2

|A| < c is equivalent to -c < A < c
|A| <= c is equivalent to -c <= A <= c

|A| > c is equivalent to A < -c or A > c
|A| >= c is equavalent to A <= -c or A >= c


|u+2|<=4

solve for u as follows:

-4 -2 <= u+2-2 <= 4-2

-------------------------------------------

|u+4| < 6

-6-4 < u+4-4 < 6-4
-10 < u < 2

-------------------------------------------

|v-5| >= 5

V-5+5 >= 5+5
