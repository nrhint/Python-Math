Linear Inequalties

|A| < c is equivalent to -c < A < c
|A| <= c is equivalent to -c <= A <= c

|A| > c is equivalent to A < -c or A > c
|A| >= c is equavalent to A <= -c or A => c


|u+2|<=4

solve for u as follows:

-4 -2 <= u+2-2 <= 4-2

-------------------------------------------

|u+4| < 6

-6-4 < u+4-4 < 6-4
-10 < u < 2

-------------------------------------------

|v-5| => 5

V-5+5 => 5+5
