Go through and rewrite all of the files to be classes. check for functionality and maybe rearrange the structure to allow for easier sharing of the functionality. Ideas include creating a master file that contains all of the classes and then create sub files that access the master file to fulfil their functions. (Example:) there is a fraction.py program in several places and it could be use in almost any function. it would be muc better if I had one copy and then all of the programs access the ne file and use it.
