Atomic number (Z) - The number of protons in a nucleus and the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

neutral atom (atom) - When the number of protons and electrons are the same in a atom.  The atom will have no positive charge or negative charge.

Ionic atoms - Any atom that is not neutral or has a different number of protons and electrons.

Cation - A positive Ion
Anion - A negative Ion.  Often the element has an IDE sufix at the end of the name. (Chlor+ide)

Ionic Bond:  Wil come out neutural.  By knowing what is the 'IDE' part of the compound will let you know what the Cation element is.  The electron is moved from one atom to another
Covelent bond:  The electron is shared by each atom.

Protons (P)- Protons define the element that you are talking about.  You cant change the number of protons without changing the element.  A proton has a positive charge.

isotopes - Atoms of a single element that differ in the number of neutrons in the nuclei

Neutrons (N) - Has no charge and is found in the nucleus

Electrons (E) - Are found in the shell or outer layers of the atom.  They have an negative charge.  This is where the variance for isotopes comes from.

atomic mass number (A) - The combined number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus

WAYS TO WRITE:
When writing a element the superscript is the mass number, the subscript is the atomic number.  Mass number = Protons + Neutrons (A = Z+N).  To find the number of neutrons subtract A-Z.

A chemical formulas the subscript os the number of atoms in the compound.

Another way to write things are for example CH3COOH (C2 H4 O2 acetic acid) is called condenced structural formula.  The way that the elements are aranged in the order they are in the element.  

To write a compound there are several ways.  Here are examples: H-H, H:H the compound is H2.
