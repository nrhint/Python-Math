Atomic number (Z) - The number of protons in a nucleus and the number of electrons in a neutral atom.

neutral atom (atom) - When the number of protons and electrons are the same in a atom.  The atom will have no positive charge or negative charge.

Ionic atoms - Any atom that is not neutral or has a different number of protons and electrons.

Cation - A positive Ion
Anion - A negative Ion

Protons (P)- Protons define the element that you are talking about.  You cant change the number of protons without changing the element.  A proton has a positive charge.

isotopes - Atoms of a single element that differ in the number of neutrons in the nuclei

Neutrons (N) - Has no charge and is found in the nucleus

Electrons (E) - Are found in the shell or outer layers of the atom.  They have an negative charge.  This is where the variance for isotopes comes from.

atomic mass number (A) - The combined number of protons and neutrons in a nucleus

When writing a element the superscript is the mass number, the subscript is the atomic number.  Mass number = Protons + Neutrons (A = Z+N).  To find the number of neutrons subtract A-Z.
