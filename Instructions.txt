This file will contin the instructions for using this repo. Mostly the math section is the part that I will focous on as the other parts are not realy intended for others.

To use the math part you will need to enter the Math folder then choose the correct folder for what you wnat to do.
Each folder should have a main.py or a runMe.py program. This should have a user interface but I am not sure how well they work. I made them so that I could use the interface. I am going to work on the geo interface so that it is easier to use and cleaner.
